## What Is a LNK File?  
A shortcut file in Windows that points to a file, folder, or application.  

## How LNK File Attacks Work
1. **Malicious LNK Creation**: An attacker creates a LNK file that contains embedded malicious payloads or commands.
2. **File Placement**: The LNK file is placed in a location where users are likely to encounter it, such as shared folders, downloads, or removable media.
3. **Execution**: When a user opens the LNK file, it executes the embedded payload or command, potentially leading to malware execution or system compromise.

## Mitigation
| **Method**                                            | **Description**                                                                                                               |

| **Disable LNK File Execution from Untrusted Sources** | Configure system policies to prevent the execution of LNK files from untrusted or unexpected locations.                       |
| **Implement Least Privilege**                         | Restrict user permissions to minimize the impact of LNK file execution, ensuring users only have the necessary access rights. |
