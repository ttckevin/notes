Multi-Function Peripherals (MFPs), such as printers and copiers, are often overlooked in penetration testing but can be valuable targets. They have network connectivity and storage for credentials, making them potential entry points into a network.

- **MFP Capabilities**: MFPs are equipped with network ports, USB drives, and interfaces for functions like printing, scanning, and emailing.
- **LDAP Integration**: MFPs often use Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for authentication and directory lookups. This integration can store and transmit sensitive credentials.

## How Passback Attack works?
1. **Access Embedded Web Service (EWS)**: Most MFPs can be accessed via a web interface with default credentials.
2. **Modify LDAP Settings**: Change the LDAP server settings in the MFP to point to a malicious server.
3. **Capture Credentials**: Set up a listener to capture LDAP authentication attempts from users. Credentials stored for LDAP or used during email lookups can be intercepted.
4. **Expand Attack**: Besides LDAP, attacks can target SMTP settings and Windows sign-in configurations on the MFP to capture additional credentials.

### Tools and Resources
- Tools like `PRET` and `Praeda` can assist in exploiting MFPs by providing capabilities for information disclosure and code execution.

## Mitigations
- Regularly update MFP firmware, change default credentials, and secure network configurations to protect against such attacks.

Note: MFPs are often under-secured and can be exploited to gain network access and escalate privileges. Their physical accessibility and poor management make them prime targets in penetration testing.
