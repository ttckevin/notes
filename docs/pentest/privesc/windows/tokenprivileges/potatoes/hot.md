The [first potato](https://github.com/foxglovesec/Potato) discovered by Stephen Breen.
#### How does it work?
**WPAD Setup**: The attacker sets up a rogue WPAD (Web Proxy Auto-Discovery) server that receives the victim's HTTP traffic. The attacker captures NTLM authentication requests directed at the WPAD server.  
1. NBNS spoofing: The attacker sends spoofed NBNS responses, tricking the victim into resolving network names through the attacker's machine instead of legitimate DNS servers.  
2. Forced DNS Failure: If the victim's DNS queries fail (e.g., due to **port exhaustion** or other issues), they may fall back to NBNS for name resolution, allowing the attacker to respond with false information.  
3. NTLM Relay: The attacker relays the captured NTLM hashes to local services (such as SMB or HTTP), which can lead to privilege escalation by executing commands with elevated privileges.
