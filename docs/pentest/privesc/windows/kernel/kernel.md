The Kernel is the core component of an operating system that acts as a bridge between the applications and the physical hardware of a computer.

|**Functionality**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Process Management**|Manages the scheduling, creation, execution, and termination of processes. Coordinates CPU time allocation and inter-process communication.|
|**Memory Management**|Allocates and deallocates memory for processes. Manages virtual memory to provide an extended amount of memory beyond physical limits.|
|**File System Management**|Handles file operations like creation, deletion, reading, writing, and directory management. Manages file access control and permissions.|
|**Device Management**|Interfaces with hardware devices through drivers. Manages and controls input and output operations for devices such as printers and disk drives.|
|**System Calls**|Provides an API for applications to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process creation, and hardware interactions.|
|**Interrupt Handling**|Responds to interrupts from hardware devices, ensuring the system can quickly react to events like user input or network packets.|
