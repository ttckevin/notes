| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- |
| **Monolithic**  | Contains all essential services within a single code block, including file management, process management, and device drivers.       | Linux kernel      |
| **Microkernel** | Includes only basic functionalities in the kernel; other services run in user space, enhancing modularity and stability.             | Minix             |
| **Hybrid**      | Combines features of both monolithic and microkernels, aiming for a balance between performance and modularity.                      | Windows NT kernel |
| **Exokernel**   | Provides minimal abstractions for hardware, allowing applications to manage hardware resources directly for specialized performance. | Exokernel OS      |
