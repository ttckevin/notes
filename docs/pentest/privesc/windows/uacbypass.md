# CVE-2019-1388 Windows Privilege Escalation Through User Account Dialog
How UAC Windows Certificate Dialog Works:  
1. User Initiates Action: When a user or an application attempts to perform an action that requires administrative privileges, such as installing or modifying certificates, a UAC prompt is triggered.  
2. UAC Prompt: The UAC Windows Certificate Dialog appears, notifying the user that the action requires administrative rights. The dialog presents information about the application and the action being requested.  
3. User Confirmation: The user must confirm the action by providing administrative credentials, typically an administratorâ€™s username and password.  
4. Privilege Elevation: Upon confirmation, Windows grants the application or process the necessary elevated privileges to carry out the requested action. This might involve launching a separate process with administrative rights.  
5. Action Execution: With the elevated privileges, the application can now perform the certificate-related operation that requires administrative access.
