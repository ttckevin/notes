## adm
Members can read many log files in `/var/log` and use `xconsole`
## shadow
Members can read the /etc/shadow file
## sudo/admin/wheel
sudo/admin (in Debian derivatives) or wheel (in CentOS/RedHat derivatives) group is a special user group used to control access to the su or sudo commands, which allow users to either execute commands or masquerade as another user (usually the super user)

/etc/sudoers
```
# Members of the admin group may gain root privileges
%admin ALL=(ALL) ALL

# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

%wheel    ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
## mlocate
Members can read database of indexed files located at `var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db`
```
cat /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db | strings | grep personal -A 3 -B 3
```
 `cat /var/lib/mlocate/mlocate.db`: Dumps the contents of the locate database      
`strings`: Filters out binary noise to extract readable text (file paths)  
`grep personal -A 3 -B 3`: Searches for entries containing the word `personal`, showing **3 lines before and after** each match

## disk
Members have access to the raw data contained in disks and partitions

## lxd/lxc
>Linux Container (LXC)

>Linux Container Daemon (LXD)

Members have write access to the LXD socket and can perform privileged actions, such as creating a root-level privilege container because LXD does not try to match the current users privileges

## docker
Members have access to manage, create, edit or delete docker containers
