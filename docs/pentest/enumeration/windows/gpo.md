## What is Group Policy Object?
GPO is a collection of Group Policy settings that defines what a system will look like and how it will behave for a defined group of users

GPOs consist of the following two components:
- Group Policy Container (GPC) - this is the LDAP part of the GPO and contains its attributes
- Group Policy Template (GPT) - this is located in `Sysvol` and contains the actual GPO settings
When a client (user or computer) processes the GPO settings, the following process takes place:
1. The client retrieves the `gpLink` attribute of all containers in its directory structure. `GpLink` contains the LDAP path of the GPOs that must be applied.
2. The client retrieves a number of attributes associated with each GPO. One of these attributes is `gPCFileSysPath` which contains the location of the actual GPO settings in SYSVOL.
3. The client establishes an SMB connection to the location pointed by [`gPCFileSysPath`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/adschema/a-gpcfilesyspath).
4. The GPO settings are retrieved and applied by the client.

## How to enumerate ?
